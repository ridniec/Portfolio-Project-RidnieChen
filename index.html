    <h5>In this project we were supposed to create a business card for ourselves, it could've be for our current self
      with a
      real occupation, or for an imagined future version of ourselves when you have our dream job. Honors students were
      required to create two separate designs with a significant difference between them so that is why I did two.

      In this Project we were expected to create a website with out own storyline, containing 8 separate webpages,
      correct use of paragraph tags, correct inline formatting tags, organized file structure, at least 1 image, chapter
      headings and at least one properly formatted list. For the design the requirements are: coherent & entertaining,
      easy to navigate, logically organized code and file structure should be: correctly structured and commented
      wherever youâ€™ve borrowed code or ideas. There are extra requirements for honor students in which I was one of
      them. The honors requirements are at least one table, customize the style of the page by modifying the included
      stylesheet and Include links for moving backward as well as forward throughout the story.
